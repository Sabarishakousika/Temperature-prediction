# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a regression model to predict temperature values using weather-related features. Implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, the model helps in forecasting temperature based on historical data.

---

## 📁 Dataset

Typical features may include:
- Date or Timestamp
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Pressure
- Target: Temperature

> *(Please verify actual column names in your dataset)*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict the temperature given historical weather data using machine learning regression techniques.

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Feature scaling and encoding
4. Train/test split
5. Train regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)
6. Evaluate using metrics like MAE, MSE, R²

---

## 🤖 Model Used

- Linear Regression (or alternative regression model)
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

---

## 🛠️ Libraries and Tools

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Sample Output

```
MAE: 1.21  
MSE: 2.14  
R² Score: 0.91
```

> *(These are example values. Replace with actual results.)*

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open `Temperature_Prediction_Test.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook step-by-step.
3. Review the model training, predictions, and evaluation results.
